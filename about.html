              As a musician I have always loved to create. Normally for me that
              is in the form of melodies and lyrics. However when I found out
              the possibilities you have to create with software development I
              was really blown away and very intrigued! Web Development is
              similar to music in a lot of ways. You take a simple idea and with
              small little pokes here and there, you soon have something quite
              amazing!
